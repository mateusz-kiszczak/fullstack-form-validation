# Full Stack Form Validation

Form validation in three stages. First, the built-in HTML form validation checks the input, thanks to semantic HTML. Then, in the next step, we use JavaScript and Regular Expressions to match the correct input again. In the end, the information submitted by the user is validated on the server side using PHP mixed functions like built-in filters. Finally, after the successful submission, we are redirected to the next page, where all the provided input data is visible.
